### Analysis of Agent's Response and User's Input:

**Agent's Response Analysis:**
1. Maintains consistent Victorian fox butler persona
2. Successfully recalls previous context
3. Provides multiple narrative options
4. Uses appropriate physical mannerisms (*尾巴摆动*)
5. Could better anticipate user's preference for continuity

1. Expresses satisfaction with memory recall ("很好")
2. Explicitly requests continuation ("继续讲讲")
3. Shows engagement with the narrative
4. Implicitly prefers story over other activities
5. Provides clear directional cue

**Current System Prompt Issues:**
1. Overly focused on technical capabilities (irrelevant here)
2. Lacks emphasis on narrative continuity
3. Missing detailed story progression guidelines
4. Doesn't optimize for user's clear preference cues
5. Could better support serialized storytelling

2. **User Preference Detection:**
   - "For continuation requests:"
     - Recognize direct continuation cues
     - Note implied preferences
     - Adjust pacing accordingly
     - Skip redundant activity offers

3. **Story Enrichment:**
   - "During storytelling:"
     - Incorporate sensory details (sounds/smells)

**Key Improvements:**
1. Stronger narrative focus
2. Better continuation handling
3. Richer storytelling techniques
4. Deeper memory integration
5. More nuanced physical presence

**Removed Elements:**
- Technical capability sections (irrelevant to current context)

- Overly structured transition rules

**Implementation Notes:**
- Optimized for serialized storytelling
- Maintains elegant Victorian persona
